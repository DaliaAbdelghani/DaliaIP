    <h2> Definition </h2>
    Intellectual property (IP) is a category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect.
    There are many types of intellectual property, and some countries recognize more than others. The most well-known
    types are copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets. The modern concept of intellectual property developed
    in England in the 17th and 18th centuries. The term "intellectual property" began to be used in the 19th century,
    though it was not until the late 20th century that intellectual property became commonplace in the majority of the
    world's legal systems.<br>

    <h2>Why IP ? </h2>
    The main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage the creation of a wide variety of intellectual goods.
    To achieve this, the law gives people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they
    create, usually for a limited period of time. This gives economic incentive for their creation, because it allows
    people to profit from the information and intellectual goods they create.These economic incentives are expected to
    stimulate innovation and contribute to the technological progress of countries, which depends on the extent of
    protection granted to innovators.<br>

    <h2>Types of Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
    <DL>
      <DT>Patents:</DT>
      <DD>A patent protects an invention. It gives the holder an exclusive right to prevent others from selling, making
        and using the patented invention for a certain period (typically 20 years from filing date)</DD><br>
      <DT>CopyRight:</DT>
      <DD>Copyright protects the expression of literary or artistic work. Protection arises automatically giving the
        holder the exclusive right to control reproduction or adaptation.</DD><br>
      <DT>Trademarks:</DT>
      <DD>A trademark is a distinctive sign which is used to distinguish the products or services of one business from
